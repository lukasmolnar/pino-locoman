## Old Examples

- COM: Move center of mass up and down, while arm end effector position remains constant.
- IK: Given desired arm end effector position and rotation, compute whole-body joint angles.
- Casadi: Formulate optimization problem in joint space (states: joint positions, inputs: joint velocities). Track desired goal state.
